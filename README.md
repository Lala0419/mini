## How We Made It
- First, we made a form that asks the user for their **Name, Birthday, and Favorite Color.**
- On the front of the card used the [UnsplashAPI](https://unsplash.com/developers) to generate a random image that matched the user's favourite color. 
- We used used** CSS animations** to generate a card that opens like a birthday card.
- We used the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to generate a random Pokemon that matched the user's favorite color.
- The card also generates a new Birthday greeting every single render.
